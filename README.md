## Installation

* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[INSTALL_DIR] ..
* make
* make install

Then, you'll find all the executables in [INSTALL_DIR]/bin and header files in [INSTALL_DIR]/include


## How to run

#### SZ3 Executable
* You can use the executable 'tools/sz3/sz3' to do the compression/decompression.

#### SZ3 C++ API
* Located in 'include/SZ3/api/sz.hpp'. 
* Requiring a modern C++ compiler.  
* Different with SZ2 API.

#### SZ3 C API
* Located in 'tools/sz3c/include/sz3c.h'
* Compatible with SZ2 API

#### SZ3 Python API
* Located in 'tools/pysz/pysz.py'
* Test file provided ('tools/pysz/test.py')
* Compatible with both SZ3 and SZ2
* Requiring SZ2/3 dynamic library

#### H5Z-SZ3
* Located in 'tools/H5Z-SZ3'
* Please add "-DBUILD_H5Z_FILTER=ON" to enable this function for CMake.
* sz3ToHDF5 and HDF5ToSz3 are provided for testing.
