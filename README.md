## Installation

* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[INSTALL_DIR] ..
* make
* make install

Then, you'll find all the executables in [INSTALL_DIR]/bin and header files in [INSTALL_DIR]/include

## 3rd party libraries/tools

* Zstandard (https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Zstandard v1.4.5 is included and will be used if libzstd can not be found by
  pkg-config.

## Testing Examples

You can use the executable 'sz3' command to do the compression/decompression.

SZ3 simplifies command line arguments in the previous version. If you are a new user, please follow the instructions
given by the executable.


## Backward Compatibility with SZ2
For backward compatibility, most of the SZ2 command line parameters are supported in SZ3. **Exceptions are listed below**.
Scripts without the parameters below should work fine by replacing SZ2 with SZ3.

| Parameter | Explanation                     | SZ3 roadmap                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| -c        | Config file                     | SZ3 has different config format with SZ2 |
| -p        | Print configuration info        | Will be supported soon                   |
| -T        | Tucker Tensor Decomposition     | Will be supported later                  |
| -P        | Point-wise relative error bound | Will be supported later                  |

## QoZ integration

The initial QoZ (quality-oriented compression optimization module) integration into SZ3 has been available in the branch **QoZ** (https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ3/tree/QoZ). Check it for details.

The branch **sz3.3_develop** (https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ3/tree/sz3.3_develop) is a lightweight QoZ integration version of SZ3, which is in development and will be the next main version of SZ3. 

## API

#### SZ3 C++ API
* Located in 'include/SZ3/api/sz.hpp'. 
* Requiring a modern C++ compiler.  
* Different with SZ2 API.

#### SZ3 C API
* Located in 'tools/sz3c/include/sz3c.h'
* Compatible with SZ2 API

#### Python API
* Located in 'tools/pysz/pysz.py'
* Test file provided ('tools/pysz/test.py')
* Compatible with both SZ3 and SZ2
* Requiring SZ2/3 dynamic library

#### Fortran API
* Special thanks to [Oscar Mojica](https://github.com/ofmla) for providing the Fortran API
* Visit [this Github repository](https://github.com/ofmla/sz3_simple_example) for details

#### H5Z-SZ3
* Located in 'tools/H5Z-SZ3'
* Please add "-DBUILD_H5Z_FILTER=ON" to enable this function for CMake.
* sz3ToHDF5 and HDF5ToSz3 are provided for testing.
